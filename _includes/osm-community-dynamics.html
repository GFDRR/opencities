      <h3>OSM Community Dynamics</h3>
      <span>Understanding mapping progress and data quality also requires looking at the local OSM community and how mappers have contributed over time. Embedded widgets in this sections allow e.g. exploring the list of top mappers who contributed to features within the city extent, with links to their OSM user profile page. A time chart of number of user contributions over pre-defined time periods (daily, weekly, monthly), also provides a picture of how consistent the mapping activity in the area is.</span>

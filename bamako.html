<p>
Bamako is Mali’s political and economic capital, home to over 2.4 million inhabitants (13 percent of the national population) . Located in Africa’s Sahel zone and situated along the Niger River, Bamako is vulnerable to recurrent floods, drought, and food insecurity. One the world’s fastest growing cities, Bamako’s urban sprawl has led to dramatic losses in green space and agricultural land; since 1990, a loss of over 50 percent of the city’s arable land has been observed . Roughly 65  percent of Bamako’s population lives in informal settlements with limited access to basic services, amplifying the pace of sprawl and land degradation .  As one of the world’s poorest countries, Mali is also one of the most vulnerable to climate change. In 2014, 98.5 percent of disaster-related economic losses in Mali were attributed to floods, amounting to $45,000,000 in damages per year . It is estimated that by 2100, average temperatures in the region will increase by up to 4 degrees Celsius, which will contribute to more intense and severe rainfall events . As a result of this temperature increase and other climatic factors, flooding of the Niger River and food and water scarcity will become severe, the effects of which will be further amplified by Bamako’s poor urban planning.

Côte d’Ivoire’s sandy coastal region faces frequent flooding, heavy surf, erosion and landslides. Most of Côte d’Ivoire’s population of 24 million resides in this tropical southern region, also home to two of its largest cities, Abidjan and San Pedro. The country is expected to see an increase in urban population and coastal settlement in the next decades which will increase exposure to coastal risks. It is projected that the coastal Ivorian population living less than 20 meters above sea level will more than double by 2050. According to the last census in 2014, Greater Abidjan Area (GAA) has a population of around 5.4 million inhabitants; this population is expected to continue to grow to seven million by 2030 and more than 10 million by 2040; thus remaining the main driver of the country's future economic growth. However, as in many large cities in neighbouring countries, the rapid and difficult to control rate of urbanization is associated with greater risks, particularly in the face of floods. Solid waste management or undersizing of the drainage network is also a barrier to Abidjan's resilience.  </p>
<p>The Open Cities Abidjan project builds the capacity of local institutional and informal actors to address the solid waste and flood management challenges facing the city of Abidjan. The project focuses on the collection of geolocated urban data including transport, drainage infrastructure, and waste disposal. As litter in Abidjan is known to obstruct drainage and aggravate flooding, the data collected under this project will help to identify the main sources along drainage channels where waste disposal is a problem, so that appropriate measures can be implemented. The participatory mapping approach with field collection campaigns will be favoured to allow a better integration of populations into the process and a better consideration of the difficulties experienced by populations living in the most affected, often informal, neighbourhoods.</p>
